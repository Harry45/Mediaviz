# Mediaviz

This repository is for my project [Automating Network Visualization and community detection of Media Sources Network from Mediacloud data.](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6265196406898688)  with Google Summer Of Code 2018. The goal is to create network visualizations with force atlas 2 layout and appropriate visual aesthetics on top of python's popular network analysis library networkx. 

# Dependencies :
